My largely non-sensical master of landscape architecture thesis. While it's not great, is foundationally untethered and includes a cringe-inducing quantity of lazy and uncritical musings, I do feel that having gotten it out of the way prepares me well for my next thesis which I think has a reasonable chance of being much better in nearly every way.
