### LA Hot Takes

This is where I plan to put all my Hot Takes about landscape architecture. I'm going to copy them across from my masters first (tweaked) and then maybe come up with even more Hot Takes.


### Hot Take 01

There's a lot of hokum in all this **More than Human** content.

### Hot Take 03

The Moonee Ponds Creek is fine as it is and doesn't need to be **Renaturated**.
