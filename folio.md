### A curated, regulary updated set of recent sketches, drawings, paintings, &c.

<span style="color:grey">*Please get in touch if you want one of these or have a request - will likely ship and/or do commissions for free because that's better than them sitting in a box under my desk.*</span>

### TWO BIG TREES FALLING INTO EACH OTHER IN THE CEMETERY

Unsure what type of trees they are, don't know much about trees. Certainly very solid, massed things. Feel as though they're not about much outside the cemetery. Coniferous? Pls let me know if you know.

### EXPLODING COFFEE MACHINE

This second hand coffee machine was a gift, but like many second hand gifts the giving was of as much use to the person getting rid of it as was to the recipiant. It worked well for a while, and reminded me of the excellent but environmentally less than ideal ALDI pod machine we have back home. It's recently developed a tendency to explode, coughing hot wet coffee grounds up all over the bench, and so I've migrated back to regular use of the percolator (which has never exploded).

### LOOKING TOWARD THE DANDENONGS

Princes Hill is in fact on top of quite a substantial hill. This becomes very clear from the centre-north (best) section of the Melbourne General Cemetery (MGC). You can see clear across to the Dandenongs from here and you often get a look at cloud/ rain as it moves across them from the city's east.
