### Boat Build

Tracking the progress of my boat build at [The Victorian Wooden Boat Centre](https://www.woodenboatcentre.com.au/). Commenced July 2022. 12 foot clinker sail boat designed and cut by [Nick Atkins](https://www.instagram.com/nick_atkins_boatbuilder/?hl=en).

### PART 05 - LAYING KEEL

**December**

<span style="color:grey">*A great way to round out work for 2022. Keel was layed, fitted to ribs, transom and stem using thickened epoxy. Clamped in place. This results in the core skeletal strucutre of the boat being locked together, ready for a clean up and then planking.*</span>

### PART 04 - CLEANING RIBS

**November**
<br />

<span style="color:grey">*Laminated ribs had to be all cleaned up, stripped of glue and then trimmed by hand to fit MDF mould. Ribs were initially trimmed back to accomodate inner keel and first 2x sets of planks. Process involved a rough cut followd by a **lot** of fine tuning.*</span>

### PART 03 - LAMINATING RIBS

**October**
<br />

<span style="color:grey">*Laminating ribs to mould of MDF frames. Ribs lamited using West Systems epoxy resin (thickened) and a ridiculous quantity of clamps. Note that ribs can only be bent this far because they have already been steamed into shape. The steamed shape will not hold on its own, but resets the timber in alignment with required curves - this significantly reduces risk of splitting and tearing.*</span>
<br />

### PART 02 - STEAMED RIBS

**The Second Half of July**
