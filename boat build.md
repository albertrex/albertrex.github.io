<span style="color:grey">*Laminating ribs to mould of MDF frames. Ribs lamited using West Systems epoxy resin (thickened) and a ridiculous quantity of clamps. Note that ribs can only be bent this far because they have already been steamed into shape. The steamed shape will not hold on its own, but resets the timber in alignment with required curves - this significantly reduces risk of splitting and tearing.*</span>
