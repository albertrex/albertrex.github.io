Hugely indulgent, bought myself a little (8wo) pup from outside Bendigo. Pup bought off Gumtree which everyone who wasn't getting the pup made sure to make their view clear on but I simply desired a pup.
Pup is roughly:
1/2 Wolfhound
1/4 Bull Arab
1/4 German Shorthaired Pointer.

Very little idea how big she'll grow or what she'll end up looking like but can confirm she is eating a huge amount.
